# CLASSIFIER-MACHINE-LEARNING
This project was done as a final assessment of the IBM MACHINE LEARNING Course, we had to develop a classifier to predict labels of a bank application to predict if a customer will default the loan payment. I have had one of the best marks among all the students, my model has a Jaccard score of 76% and f1 score of 86%, using logistic regression.

I have used GridSearchCV to tune well my model as well as trying different models and evaluating them all with different metrics and cross-validation.
